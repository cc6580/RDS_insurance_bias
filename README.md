# Investigating Bias in Insurance Premium Prediction

As the importance of data collection and interpretation has been proven in the past decade, more and more companies, organizations, 
and government branches have invented and deployed the ADS(Automated Data System) to assist them 
to make decisions under various scenarios. However, the discussion of these ADS applications also arises, 
arguing such a technique is constantly bringing unfairness into production which exerts a negative impact on society from various angles. 

The ADS (automated decision-making system) focused in this project aims to use customers past medical expenses 
and their features such as sex, age, BMI, and etc. to predict their future expenses, 
ultimately to help insurance companies make decisions on premium charges. 
The purpose of this project is to investigate the methodology and implementation of the ADS and 
assess whether there exists bias where the system favors one group over another unfairly, 
such as charging a particular group with the same feature values over another group.
